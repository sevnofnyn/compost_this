                                    <div class="accordion-panel"> <p>Composting is important because it saves a valuable resource from ending up in the landfill or incinerator. Your food scraps and other items can break down and become dirt!</p>
                                        <p>I noticed a lot of information for composting is in static form and not a searchable database. I wanted a quick resource to look up an item. I will be starting with more basic items and adding to the database. You can also contact me via the form on the website and ask about a particular item.</p>

                                    <div class="accordion-panel"> <p>Composting can be done almost anywhere. If you live somewhere with sometimes arctic winters like I do, the process is a little different for the worms, and for my backyard bin. First, I have to bring in my worms from the porch when the temperature dips below 40F/5C. Also they don't really like it above 80F/26C, so please keep them in the shade if they are outside in the heat.  </p>
                                        <p>Also, your backyard bin will slow down the breakdown process in the winter if it gets cold like it does in Minnesota. You can still choose to add to it, but understand your bin will fill up quite a bit before it can start breaking down again in the spring/summer. </p></div>
